1. Product Overview

Product Name (working): Vendor Compliance Copilot
One-liner:

A SaaS platform that tracks supplier compliance documents, expiry dates, and risks — and automatically keeps vendors and internal teams on top of renewals.

Primary Goal:
Replace messy spreadsheets and email chains with a single source of truth for vendor compliance, drastically reducing risk of non-compliance, production disruption, or failed audits.

Target Customers (Initial ICP):

Mid-sized manufacturers (50–500 suppliers)

Procurement / Vendor Management teams

Compliance & Quality teams (ISO, safety, ESG, etc.)

2. Problem Statement

Companies with many vendors must collect and maintain:

Certificates (ISO 9001, ISO 27001, HACCP, etc.)

Insurance documents

Safety & environmental compliance

Contracts and amendments

ESG/sustainability documents

Regulatory licenses

Today this is usually handled by:

Excel / Google Sheets

Shared drives

Manual email reminders

People’s memory

Pain points:

Expired Documents Go Unnoticed

Vendor’s insurance expired last month → risk exposure

ISO certification expires → non-compliance in audits

Manual, Error-Prone Follow-Ups

Procurement chases vendors by email

No consistent reminder logic

No Single Source of Truth

Compliance status scattered across folders, inboxes, and personal spreadsheets

No quick “at a glance” risk view for leadership

Audit & Customer Pressure

Customers ask: “Prove your suppliers are compliant.”

Teams scramble to compile docs from multiple systems

3. Product Vision

To become the mission-critical system of record for vendor compliance status, documents, and risk — especially for mid-market manufacturers and supply chain–heavy companies.

Long term:

Integrate with ERP / Procurement tools

Provide AI-driven risk scoring

Become standard for “supplier compliance dashboards” in audits and customer reviews

4. Personas
4.1. Priya – Head of Procurement

Cares about: continuity of supply, vendor performance, minimal disruption

Problems: last-minute fire drills when vendors fall out of compliance, no simple overview

Needs: simple dashboards, red/amber/green view of vendor compliance

4.2. Mark – Vendor Compliance Manager

Cares about: collecting and updating documents, passing audits

Problems: constantly chasing vendors, no automation

Needs: automated reminders, clear status for each document type, bulk imports

4.3. Ana – Vendor Contact (External)

Cares about: quickly fulfilling customer requirements

Problems: too many email threads, unclear what’s missing

Needs: simple portal link; upload docs; see what’s pending and due

5. Goals & Non-Goals (MVP)
5.1. MVP Goals (Release 1)

Let customers create and manage a vendor list.

Define document types & requirements per vendor category (e.g., ISO certs, insurance).

Track document uploads, expirations, and status.

Automatically remind vendors and internal owners before expiry.

Provide a compliance dashboard (per vendor & portfolio).

Create an audit-ready log of uploads, approvals, and changes.

5.2. Non-Goals (for MVP)

Full contract authoring / e-signature (integrate later with DocuSign, etc.).

Deep ERP integration (SAP/Oracle) in v1 — only simple CSV export/import.

Complex vendor onboarding questionnaires (just basic in v1).

Native mobile apps (web responsive only).

AI OCR/extraction of fields from PDFs (future phase).

6. Core Use Cases & User Stories
6.1. Vendor Onboarding & Setup

User Story 1:
As a Compliance Manager, I want to add a new vendor and assign required document types based on vendor category (e.g., “Packaging supplier”) so that I can standardize requirements.

User Story 2:
As a Compliance Manager, I want to bulk import vendors from a CSV so that I can migrate from my spreadsheet quickly.

6.2. Document Collection & Management

User Story 3:
As a Compliance Manager, I want to send a secure link to vendors where they can see requested documents and upload them, so I don’t have to manage attachments in email.

User Story 4:
As a Vendor Contact, I want to see a simple list of required documents, their status, and due dates, so I know what to upload and by when.

User Story 5:
As a Compliance Manager, I want to review uploaded documents and approve/reject them, optionally adding comments, so I can ensure they meet standards.

6.3. Expiry Management & Notifications

User Story 6:
As a Compliance Manager, I want to configure reminder rules (e.g., 90/60/30 days before expiry) so that vendors and internal owners are notified ahead of time.

User Story 7:
As a Vendor Contact, I want to receive email reminders with direct links to renew/replace expiring documents, so I don’t forget.

User Story 8:
As a Head of Procurement, I want to receive weekly summaries of vendors with documents expiring soon so I can proactively manage risk.

6.4. Compliance Dashboard & Reporting

User Story 9:
As a Head of Procurement, I want to see a dashboard with compliance percentages (e.g., “78% of strategic vendors fully compliant”) so I can evaluate risk.

User Story 10:
As a Compliance Manager, I want to generate an export (Excel/PDF) of all vendors and their document statuses for audits.

6.5. Audit Trail & Governance

User Story 11:
As a Compliance Manager, I want a log of all actions on each document (uploaded by, approved by, timestamps) so I can present evidence in audits.

User Story 12:
As an Admin, I want role-based access (Admin, Procurement, Compliance, Read-Only) so only authorized people can view/modify vendor documents.

13. Future Roadmap Ideas (Post-MVP)

AI document reader: auto-recognize document type, expiry date, vendor name from PDFs.

Vendor risk scoring: combine doc completeness + vendor category + region.

Questionnaire module: send vendor risk questionnaires (ESG, InfoSec, etc.) and store results.

Insights & benchmarking: e.g., “Most vendors in X category are late in providing insurance.”

API-first platform: for other procurement tools to plug into your compliance data.
